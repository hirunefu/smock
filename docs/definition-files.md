# Definition files

Definition files declare the Mocks smock serves and their Stubs. They live
in a definitions directory, such as `defs/`, that `smock serve --dir` and
`smock check` read:

- The Definition files are the regular files at the top level whose names
  end in `.json`, `.yaml` or `.yml`. Symlinks are followed. A YAML file
  means exactly what the equivalent JSON file means; smock accepts only the
  safe subset of YAML that the [README](../README.md) describes.
- Names that start with `.` are skipped, which covers the `..data` entries
  of Kubernetes ConfigMap volumes.
- smock reads the files in byte-wise order of their names, and reads them
  together, as one definition set: a Stub can belong to a Mock that another
  file declares.
- Body files live in the body-file subdirectory, `files/` by default
  (`--body-file-dir`, `SMOCK_BODY_FILE_DIR`). smock reads them when it
  loads the Definition files, and serves them from memory.

## Hosts and the Default Mock

One smock can stand in for several services. Each Mock lists the Hosts it
answers to, and a request goes to the Mock whose `hosts` include its Host:

```yaml
mocks:
  - name: users
    hosts: [users.example.com, "users:8080"]
    default: true
  - name: orders
    hosts: [orders.example.com]
```

- A request's Host is the authority of an absolute-form target, such as
  `GET http://orders.example.com/orders/1 HTTP/1.1`, or else its `Host`
  header.
- Hosts are exact names, with no wildcards. They are compared
  case-insensitively, without the port and without a trailing dot, so
  `Users.Example.com.:8080` is the Host `users.example.com`. An IPv6 address
  is written in brackets, such as `[::1]:8080`.
- Each Host belongs to at most one Mock. The same Host repeated within one
  Mock is fine.

A request whose Host no Mock lists, or that has none (HTTP/1.0 allows that),
goes to the Default Mock:

- the Mock marked `default: true`; at most one Mock may be marked;
- otherwise the only Mock, when the definition set declares exactly one, so
  a single Mock answers on `localhost` without any `hosts`;
- with no Mock declared at all, including an empty or missing definitions
  directory, smock serves one empty Default Mock named `default`, with no
  Hosts.

Every response the Default Mock sends because no Host matched, including
its no-match response, carries a header that says so, so that a mistyped
Host does not silently succeed:

```http
Smock-Mock: users; via=default
```

The header is ASCII: a Mock name that is not an HTTP token has its other
bytes percent-encoded, as in `%E3%83%A6...%20API`. A request for one of the
Default Mock's own Hosts gets no header.

Without a Default Mock, such a request gets a 404 that names its Host and
every Host the Mocks declare, both normalised:

```json
{"error":"no Mock for this Host","host":"usres.example.com","acceptedHosts":["users.example.com","users","orders.example.com"]}
```

`host` is `null` for a request without a Host.

## How a Stub matches a request

A Stub's `request` lists the conditions a request must meet. Every condition
given must hold, and a condition that is left out matches anything, so a
Stub without `request` matches every request of its Mock.

| Condition | A request meets it when |
|---|---|
| `method` | its method is exactly this, case and all, such as `GET`. |
| `path` | its path, percent-decoded and without the query, is exactly this. `/users/a%20b` meets `"/users/a b"`. `{ "pattern": … }`: the pattern matches the whole path. |
| `query` | each listed parameter is present, and one of its values, decoded, is exactly the given value, or matches the given `{ "pattern": … }` as a whole. Parameters that are not listed are ignored. |
| `headers` | each listed header is present, its name compared case-insensitively, and one of its values is exactly the given value, or matches the given `{ "pattern": … }` as a whole. Headers that are not listed are ignored. |
| `body` | a string: the body is exactly this text in UTF-8. `{ "pattern": … }`: the pattern matches the whole body. `{ "json": … }`: the body parses as JSON and contains the given value. |

Query parameters are decoded as HTML forms encode them: `%20` and `+` both
stand for a space, so `?q=a+b` meets `"query": { "q": "a b" }`. A parameter
without `=` has the empty value. When a parameter or a header is repeated,
the condition holds when any one of its values matches.

A `json` condition is a subset match:

- an object needs each listed key, with a value that matches in turn, and
  may have other keys;
- an array needs the same length, matched element by element;
- any other value must be equal: strings exactly, numbers by their value
  (`1` and `1.0` are equal), and `true`, `false` and `null` themselves.

A body that does not parse as JSON never meets a `json` condition.

```json
{
  "id": "create-user",
  "mock": "users",
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/users",
    "query": { "dryRun": "true" },
    "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    "body": { "json": { "name": "Alice", "roles": ["admin"] } }
  },
  "response": { "status": 201 }
}
```

### Pattern conditions

The path, a query parameter, a header and the body can each be given as a
pattern instead of an exact value, in RE2 syntax:

```json
{
  "id": "get-user",
  "mock": "users",
  "request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "path": { "pattern": "/users/[0-9]+" },
    "query": { "fields": { "pattern": "[a-z]+(,[a-z]+)*" } },
    "headers": { "Authorization": { "pattern": "Bearer [A-Za-z0-9._-]+" } }
  },
  "response": { "status": 200 }
}
```

- A pattern must match the whole value, not only part of it, so it needs
  no `^` or `$`: `/users/[0-9]+` meets `/users/42` but not
  `/users/42/orders` or `/api/users/42`.
- It is matched against the same value as an exact condition: the
  percent-decoded path without the query, the decoded values of a query
  parameter, the values of a header, and the body. When a parameter or a
  header is repeated, any one of its values may match.
- The body is matched as text in UTF-8. `.` does not match a line break
  unless the pattern turns on the `s` flag, as in `(?s)BEGIN.*END`. A body
  that is not valid UTF-8 never meets a pattern, not even `(?s).*`.
- Exact, pattern and `json` conditions can be mixed on one Stub, which then
  matches only when all of them hold. Stubs with patterns are tried in the
  same order as any other Stub.

smock supports a subset of RE2 syntax, which the
[RE2 module's README](../re2/README.mbt.md#syntax-in-r1) lists: literals,
`.`, bracket classes, `\d`, `\w` and `\s`, anchors and word boundaries,
groups, alternation, repetitions (counts up to 1000) and the flags `i`, `s`
and `m`. Matching takes time linear in the length of the value, whatever
the pattern, so no pattern can stall smock.

Patterns are compiled once, when smock loads the Definition files. A
pattern that does not compile, or that uses RE2 syntax outside the subset,
such as the Unicode class `\p{Greek}`, makes the definition set invalid.
`smock check` reports it, and `smock serve` does not start, with the JSON
Pointer of the `pattern` field and the position of the problem in the
pattern, counted in characters from 0:

```console
users.json: /stubs/0/request/path/pattern: is not a valid pattern: position 7: missing closing )
users.json: /stubs/1/request/headers/X-Region/pattern: is not a valid pattern: position 0: Unicode class \p{Greek} is not supported in R1
```

### Which Stub answers

The first Stub that matches answers. Within a Mock, Stubs are tried in this
order:

1. By `priority`: a lower number is tried first. A Stub without a priority
   is tried after every Stub with one.
2. Among equal priorities, in declaration order: files in byte-wise order
   of their names, then Stubs by their position in the file.

So a specific Stub can win over a general one wherever it is declared, by
giving it a lower priority number.

smock does not try every Stub in turn: an index, built when the Definition
files are loaded, finds the Stubs whose `method` and exact `path` fit the
request. The index never changes which Stub answers. A Stub with a
`method` and no exact `path` is tried for every request with that method,
and a Stub with neither, such as one with only a path pattern, for every
request of its Mock, each in its place in the order. Large definition sets
stay fast when most Stubs have an exact path.

### When no Stub matches

The Mock answers with its `noMatch.status`, 404 by default, and the body
`{"error":"no Stub matched"}` with `Content-Type: application/json`. Give a
Mock the status its real service returns for unknown requests:

```json
{ "mocks": [{ "name": "users", "noMatch": { "status": 501 } }] }
```

The response also names the *Near miss*: the Stub that came closest, and
the conditions it failed, in a `Smock-Near-Miss` header. With this Stub:

```json
{
  "id": "get-user",
  "mock": "users",
  "request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/users/1",
    "headers": { "X-Api-Key": "secret" }
  },
  "response": { "status": 200 }
}
```

`POST /users/1` without an `X-Api-Key` header gets

```http
Smock-Near-Miss: get-user; failed=method,header:x-api-key
```

The Near miss is the Stub of the Mock that failed the fewest conditions; on
a tie, the one tried first. Each of these counts as one condition: the
method, the path, each listed query parameter, each listed header, and the
body. They are named `method`, `path`, `query:<name>`, `header:<name>` (in
lower case) and `body`, in that order. The header is ASCII only and never
carries what a condition expects or what the request sent: the Stub ID and
query and header names are percent-encoded where they hold anything other
than the characters of an HTTP token. A Mock without Stubs, and a request
for a Host that no Mock answers, get no `Smock-Near-Miss` header.

A request that matches pays nothing for this: smock counts failed
conditions only once every Stub has failed to match.

## Responses

A Stub's `response` has a `status`, `headers`, and a body. smock sets
`Content-Length` from the body; `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding` and
`Connection` cannot be given. The body is either inline, as text in UTF-8:

```json
"response": { "status": 200, "body": "{\"id\":1}" }
```

or read from a body file, by its path relative to the body-file
subdirectory:

```json
"response": {
  "status": 200,
  "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  "bodyFile": "users/1.json"
}
```

serves the bytes of `files/users/1.json` exactly as they are. The path
cannot leave the body-file subdirectory, and none of its names may start
with `.`. A path that breaks this rule, or names a file that does not
exist, is reported with the file and JSON Pointer of the `bodyFile`, by
`smock check` and when `smock serve` starts.

### Server-Sent Events

Instead of a body, a response can stream `events`, to mock a streaming API:

```json
"response": {
  "status": 200,
  "headers": { "Cache-Control": "no-cache" },
  "events": [
    { "data": "first" },
    { "delay": 250, "event": "update", "id": "2", "data": "line 1\nline 2" }
  ]
}
```

smock sends the status and the headers at once, with
`Content-Type: text/event-stream` unless the Stub gives its own
`Content-Type`. Then, for each event, it waits the event's `delay` (in
milliseconds, counted from the previous event or, for the first one, from
the headers; 0 by default) and writes the event:

```text
data: first

event: update
id: 2
data: line 1
data: line 2

```

- `data` is required. Each of its lines becomes its own `data:` line.
- `event` (the event type) and `id` are written only when given. Each is
  one line, and `id` has no NUL characters.
- The stream ends after the last event. To an HTTP/1.1 client it is sent
  with chunked framing, so the connection carries the next request. An
  HTTP/1.0 client gets it unframed, and smock closes the connection to end
  it.
- While a stream waits, smock serves every other connection. A client that
  closes the connection mid-stream ends that stream: smock notices when it
  next writes an event.

## Faults

A Stub can inject Faults, to test how a client handles slow and failing
calls. Its `fault` has a delay, a connection Fault, or both, and an optional
seed:

```json
{
  "id": "get-user",
  "mock": "users",
  "request": { "method": "GET", "path": "/users/1" },
  "response": { "status": 200, "body": "{\"id\":1}" },
  "fault": {
    "delay": { "lognormal": { "median": 80, "sigma": 0.6 }, "probability": 0.5 },
    "connection": { "kind": "close", "probability": 0.01 },
    "seed": 42
  }
}
```

### Delays

A `delay` makes smock wait before it writes the status line. Meanwhile it
keeps serving other connections. The delay is drawn from one distribution,
in whole milliseconds:

| Distribution | Delay |
|---|---|
| `"fixed": 100` | always 100 ms. |
| `"uniform": { "min": 50, "max": 150 }` | a whole number of milliseconds from `min` to `max`, both included, each equally likely. `min` must not exceed `max`. |
| `"lognormal": { "median": 80, "sigma": 0.6 }` | log-normal: half the delays are below `median`, and `sigma`, the standard deviation of the delay's natural logarithm, sets how long the tail of slow responses is. |

`probability`, from 0 to 1, is the share of matched requests that are
delayed. Without it, every matched request is.

### Connection Faults

A `connection` Fault makes a request fail at the connection level, instead
of getting its response:

- `close`: smock reads the request, then closes the connection (a FIN)
  without writing anything.
- `partial`: smock writes the status line, the headers, with the
  `Content-Length` of the whole body, and the first half of the body, then
  closes the connection. The client sees a response cut short. For
  Server-Sent Events, the first half is the first half of the events,
  rounded down, each after its delay, and the stream is not ended.
- `reset` is in the JSON Schema but not supported yet.

`probability`, from 0 to 1, is the share of matched requests that fail;
without it, every matched request fails. A Stub with both a delay and a
connection Fault waits first, then fails.

### Seeds

Each matched request draws whether its delay and its connection Fault
apply, and how long the delay is.

- A Stub with a `seed`, from 0 to 9007199254740991, has its own generator.
  smock creates it when it loads the Definition files, and again from the
  seed when a [reload](#reloading) swaps in a new definition set, and it
  advances once per request the Stub matches. So the n-th request a seeded Stub matches
  gets the same Faults in every run, whatever requests other Stubs get. The
  generator is a fixed algorithm, the same on every platform.
- Stubs without a seed draw from the process generator, which they share.
  smock picks its seed at startup and logs it:

  ```json
  {"time":"2026-10-13T09:12:44.512Z","level":"info","msg":"random seed","seed":5126750341862113}
  ```

  To replay a run, start smock with that seed (`--seed`, `SMOCK_SEED`): the
  same requests in the same order then get the same Faults.

## The JSON Schema

The format of Definition files is published as a JSON Schema, one per
format version. The Schema of version 1 is at

<https://hirunefu.github.io/smock/schema/v1/definitions.json>

and that URL is also its `$id`. Its source is
[`schema/v1/definitions.json`](../schema/v1/definitions.json). A file
without `version` is read as version 1; any other version is rejected.

The Schema describes every field of format version 1, including fields smock
does not implement yet. smock rejects those with a message saying they are
not supported yet, so a file never means something smock silently ignores.
smock also rejects any field the Schema does not define.

## Reloading

`smock serve` watches the definitions directory, body-file subdirectory
included, and reloads the definition set when its files change, without a
restart:

- Adding, editing, renaming or removing a Definition file or a body file
  triggers a reload. So does a Kubernetes ConfigMap update, which swaps the
  `..data` symlink and keeps the visible names. Any change in the directory
  counts, so a reload can also find nothing new.
- Changes are coalesced: smock reloads once they have been quiet for
  250 ms, so a burst of changes gives one reload. It also polls the
  directory every 10 s, in case a change went unnoticed, and reloads when
  the files differ from those it read last. A definitions directory that
  does not exist yet is polled until it appears. One that cannot be watched
  for another reason, such as the inotify limits, is only polled, and smock
  logs a warning.
- A reload reads and validates every file, builds a whole new definition
  set and swaps it in at once, so no request sees half of a change.
  Requests already being handled finish with the set they started with,
  body-file bytes included.
- A Mock the new set no longer declares is gone: its Hosts resolve like any
  unknown Host.
- When the new set is invalid, smock keeps serving the current one and
  reports every problem, as `smock check` would, in the Admin API status, in
  a log entry and in the reload metric. Fix the files, and the next reload
  swaps the fixed set in.
- When the new set has the digest of the one served, nothing is swapped.
- Without `--dir`, there is nothing to watch and nothing is reloaded.

Each definition set has a *definition set digest*: a short content hash of
its Definition files and body files, so that replicas serving the same files
report the same digest. While a ConfigMap update rolls out, the digest in
each replica's status shows which set it serves. The digest is the first 12
hex digits of the SHA-256 of every file, framed one after another: the
Definition files in byte-wise order of their names (relative to the
definitions directory), then the body files in the same order (relative to
the body-file subdirectory). Each file is framed as

- one byte, `D` for a Definition file or `B` for a body file;
- the length of its name in UTF-8 bytes, as an 8-byte big-endian number,
  then the name;
- the length of its contents, as an 8-byte big-endian number, then the
  contents.

Every part carries its length, so two different sets never frame to the
same bytes. Files that are not part of the set, such as `notes.txt` or
`.hidden.json`, do not change the digest.

`GET /v1/status` on the Admin API shows the digest served and the result
of the last reload (`null` until the first one), as
[openapi/admin.json](../openapi/admin.json) defines them:

```json
{
  "digest": "3f1c0a9b2e7d",
  "lastReload": {
    "at": "2026-10-13T09:12:44.317Z",
    "result": "failed",
    "errors": [
      { "file": "users.json", "pointer": "/stubs/0/response/status",
        "message": "must be an integer from 200 to 599" }
    ]
  }
}
```

`result` is `swapped` (the new set is served now), `unchanged` (it had the
digest served) or `failed` (it was invalid; the previous set is still
served). Each reload also writes one log entry: `definitions reloaded` with
`oldDigest` and `newDigest`, or `definitions reload failed` with the digest
still served and every error. The Prometheus counter
`smock_definition_reloads_total` counts reloads by `result`. A failed reload
does not change readiness: `/readyz` on the admin port still passes, so one
bad commit does not drain every Pod.

## Checking a definitions directory

`smock check <dir>` reads a definitions directory the way `smock serve`
does, so a directory that passes `smock check` loads in `smock serve`, and
the reverse. It prints every problem on its own line, with the file and a
JSON Pointer to the value, and exits with status 1. A valid directory
prints nothing, apart from [warnings](#warnings), and exits with status 0.

```console
$ smock check defs
20-orders.json: /stubs/0/mock: no file declares the Mock "orders"
20-orders.json: /stubs/1/request/path: must start with /
$ echo $?
1
```

`smock check` also checks the rules the Schema cannot express, because they
span the Mocks and files of the set: Mock names and Stub IDs are unique, no
two Mocks claim the same Host after normalisation, at most one Mock is
marked `default`, and every Stub names a Mock that some file declares. A
duplicate is reported where it occurs the second time, in file-name order,
and the message names the first. It also compiles every
[pattern](#pattern-conditions), which the Schema accepts as any string.

In CI, run it as a step that fails the build:

```yaml
- run: smock check defs
```

### Warnings

For a valid directory, `smock check` also warns about Stubs that can never
match, because an earlier Stub of the same Mock always matches first. Each
warning is one line, marked `warning:`, with the file and JSON Pointer of
the shadowed Stub, and names the Stub that shadows it. Warnings do not
change the exit status:

```console
$ smock check defs
users.json: /stubs/1: warning: the Stub "user-1" can never match: the Stub "any-user" at users.json: /stubs/0 is tried first and matches every request this one would
$ echo $?
0
```

"Earlier" means earlier in the order Stubs are [tried](#which-stub-answers).
A Stub `s` is shadowed by an earlier Stub `t` when `t` has a subset of
`s`'s conditions:

- `t` has no method, or the same method as `s`;
- `t` has no path, the same exact path as `s`, or a pattern that matches
  `s`'s exact path;
- each of `t`'s query, header and body conditions is also in `s`, written
  the same way (header names in any case).

smock does not compare two patterns, or a pattern or `json` condition with
another condition: it warns only when the shadowing is certain, so a
warning is never a false alarm, but some Stubs that can never match are
not reported.

## Editor support

Editors that understand JSON Schema validate and complete Definition files
once they are associated with the Schema. In Visual Studio Code, add this to
the workspace's `.vscode/settings.json`, with the path of your definitions
directory:

```json
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["defs/*.json"],
      "url": "https://hirunefu.github.io/smock/schema/v1/definitions.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Do not add a `$schema` field to the files themselves: smock rejects fields
the Schema does not define.

## Writing Definition files in another configuration language

smock reads only JSON and YAML, but any configuration language that exports
JSON works. This Jsonnet file,
[`docs/examples/users.jsonnet`](examples/users.jsonnet), writes one Stub per
user with a function:

```jsonnet
local getUser(id, name) = {
  id: 'get-user-%d' % id,
  mock: 'users',
  request: { method: 'GET', path: '/users/%d' % id },
  response: {
    status: 200,
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: std.manifestJsonMinified({ id: id, name: name }),
  },
};

{
  version: 1,
  mocks: [{ name: 'users' }],
  stubs: [getUser(1, 'Alice'), getUser(2, 'Bob'), getUser(3, 'Carol')],
}
```

Export it into the definitions directory, then check the result:

```sh
jsonnet users.jsonnet -o defs/users.json
smock check defs
```

The exported file is committed as the fixture
[`schema/v1/fixtures/valid/users-from-jsonnet.json`](../schema/v1/fixtures/valid/users-from-jsonnet.json),
so CI checks it with the rest. CUE (`cue export --out json`) and Pkl
(`pkl eval -f json`) work the same way.
