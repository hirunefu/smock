# Definition files

Definition files declare the Mocks smock serves and their Stubs. They live
in a definitions directory, such as `defs/`, that `smock serve --dir` and
`smock check` read:

- The Definition files are the regular files at the top level whose names
  end in `.json`, `.yaml` or `.yml`. Symlinks are followed. A YAML file
  means exactly what the equivalent JSON file means; smock accepts only the
  safe subset of YAML that the [README](../README.md) describes.
- Names that start with `.` are skipped, which covers the `..data` entries
  of Kubernetes ConfigMap volumes.
- smock reads the files in byte-wise order of their names, and reads them
  together, as one definition set: a Stub can belong to a Mock that another
  file declares.
- Body files live in the body-file subdirectory, `files/` by default
  (`--body-file-dir`, `SMOCK_BODY_FILE_DIR`). smock reads them when it
  loads the Definition files, and serves them from memory.

## Hosts and the Default Mock

One smock can stand in for several services. Each Mock lists the Hosts it
answers to, and a request goes to the Mock whose `hosts` include its Host:

```yaml
mocks:
  - name: users
    hosts: [users.example.com, "users:8080"]
    default: true
  - name: orders
    hosts: [orders.example.com]
```

- A request's Host is the authority of an absolute-form target, such as
  `GET http://orders.example.com/orders/1 HTTP/1.1`, or else its `Host`
  header.
- Hosts are exact names, with no wildcards. They are compared
  case-insensitively, without the port and without a trailing dot, so
  `Users.Example.com.:8080` is the Host `users.example.com`. An IPv6 address
  is written in brackets, such as `[::1]:8080`.
- Each Host belongs to at most one Mock. The same Host repeated within one
  Mock is fine.

A request whose Host no Mock lists, or that has none (HTTP/1.0 allows that),
goes to the Default Mock:

- the Mock marked `default: true`; at most one Mock may be marked;
- otherwise the only Mock, when the definition set declares exactly one, so
  a single Mock answers on `localhost` without any `hosts`;
- with no Mock declared at all, including an empty or missing definitions
  directory, smock serves one empty Default Mock named `default`, with no
  Hosts.

Every response the Default Mock sends because no Host matched, including
its no-match response, carries a header that says so, so that a mistyped
Host does not silently succeed:

```http
Smock-Mock: users; via=default
```

The header is ASCII: a Mock name that is not an HTTP token has its other
bytes percent-encoded, as in `%E3%83%A6...%20API`. A request for one of the
Default Mock's own Hosts gets no header.

Without a Default Mock, such a request gets a 404 that names its Host and
every Host the Mocks declare, both normalised:

```json
{"error":"no Mock for this Host","host":"usres.example.com","acceptedHosts":["users.example.com","users","orders.example.com"]}
```

`host` is `null` for a request without a Host.

## How a Stub matches a request

A Stub's `request` lists the conditions a request must meet. Every condition
given must hold, and a condition that is left out matches anything, so a
Stub without `request` matches every request of its Mock.

| Condition | A request meets it when |
|---|---|
| `method` | its method is exactly this, case and all, such as `GET`. |
| `path` | its path, percent-decoded and without the query, is exactly this. `/users/a%20b` meets `"/users/a b"`. |
| `query` | each listed parameter is present, and one of its values, decoded, is exactly the given value. Parameters that are not listed are ignored. |
| `headers` | each listed header is present, its name compared case-insensitively, and one of its values is exactly the given value. Headers that are not listed are ignored. |
| `body` | a string: the body is exactly this text in UTF-8. `{ "json": … }`: the body parses as JSON and contains the given value. |

Query parameters are decoded as HTML forms encode them: `%20` and `+` both
stand for a space, so `?q=a+b` meets `"query": { "q": "a b" }`. A parameter
without `=` has the empty value. When a parameter or a header is repeated,
the condition holds when any one of its values matches.

A `json` condition is a subset match:

- an object needs each listed key, with a value that matches in turn, and
  may have other keys;
- an array needs the same length, matched element by element;
- any other value must be equal: strings exactly, numbers by their value
  (`1` and `1.0` are equal), and `true`, `false` and `null` themselves.

A body that does not parse as JSON never meets a `json` condition.

```json
{
  "id": "create-user",
  "mock": "users",
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/users",
    "query": { "dryRun": "true" },
    "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    "body": { "json": { "name": "Alice", "roles": ["admin"] } }
  },
  "response": { "status": 201 }
}
```

### Which Stub answers

The first Stub that matches answers. Within a Mock, Stubs are tried in this
order:

1. By `priority`: a lower number is tried first. A Stub without a priority
   is tried after every Stub with one.
2. Among equal priorities, in declaration order: files in byte-wise order
   of their names, then Stubs by their position in the file.

So a specific Stub can win over a general one wherever it is declared, by
giving it a lower priority number.

### When no Stub matches

The Mock answers with its `noMatch.status`, 404 by default, and the body
`{"error":"no Stub matched"}` with `Content-Type: application/json`. Give a
Mock the status its real service returns for unknown requests:

```json
{ "mocks": [{ "name": "users", "noMatch": { "status": 501 } }] }
```

## Responses

A Stub's `response` has a `status`, `headers`, and a body. smock sets
`Content-Length` from the body; `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding` and
`Connection` cannot be given. The body is either inline, as text in UTF-8:

```json
"response": { "status": 200, "body": "{\"id\":1}" }
```

or read from a body file, by its path relative to the body-file
subdirectory:

```json
"response": {
  "status": 200,
  "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  "bodyFile": "users/1.json"
}
```

serves the bytes of `files/users/1.json` exactly as they are. The path
cannot leave the body-file subdirectory, and none of its names may start
with `.`. A path that breaks this rule, or names a file that does not
exist, is reported with the file and JSON Pointer of the `bodyFile`, by
`smock check` and when `smock serve` starts.

### Server-Sent Events

Instead of a body, a response can stream `events`, to mock a streaming API:

```json
"response": {
  "status": 200,
  "headers": { "Cache-Control": "no-cache" },
  "events": [
    { "data": "first" },
    { "delay": 250, "event": "update", "id": "2", "data": "line 1\nline 2" }
  ]
}
```

smock sends the status and the headers at once, with
`Content-Type: text/event-stream` unless the Stub gives its own
`Content-Type`. Then, for each event, it waits the event's `delay` (in
milliseconds, counted from the previous event or, for the first one, from
the headers; 0 by default) and writes the event:

```text
data: first

event: update
id: 2
data: line 1
data: line 2

```

- `data` is required. Each of its lines becomes its own `data:` line.
- `event` (the event type) and `id` are written only when given. Each is
  one line, and `id` has no NUL characters.
- The stream ends after the last event. To an HTTP/1.1 client it is sent
  with chunked framing, so the connection carries the next request. An
  HTTP/1.0 client gets it unframed, and smock closes the connection to end
  it.
- While a stream waits, smock serves every other connection. A client that
  closes the connection mid-stream ends that stream: smock notices when it
  next writes an event.

## The JSON Schema

The format of Definition files is published as a JSON Schema, one per
format version. The Schema of version 1 is at

<https://hirunefu.github.io/smock/schema/v1/definitions.json>

and that URL is also its `$id`. Its source is
[`schema/v1/definitions.json`](../schema/v1/definitions.json). A file
without `version` is read as version 1; any other version is rejected.

The Schema describes every field of format version 1, including fields smock
does not implement yet. smock rejects those with a message saying they are
not supported yet, so a file never means something smock silently ignores.
smock also rejects any field the Schema does not define.

## Checking a definitions directory

`smock check <dir>` reads a definitions directory the way `smock serve`
does, so a directory that passes `smock check` loads in `smock serve`, and
the reverse. It prints every problem on its own line, with the file and a
JSON Pointer to the value, and exits with status 1. A valid directory
prints nothing and exits with status 0.

```console
$ smock check defs
20-orders.json: /stubs/0/mock: no file declares the Mock "orders"
20-orders.json: /stubs/1/request/path: must start with /
$ echo $?
1
```

`smock check` also checks the rules the Schema cannot express, because they
span the Mocks and files of the set: Mock names and Stub IDs are unique, no
two Mocks claim the same Host after normalisation, at most one Mock is
marked `default`, and every Stub names a Mock that some file declares. A
duplicate is reported where it occurs the second time, in file-name order,
and the message names the first.

In CI, run it as a step that fails the build:

```yaml
- run: smock check defs
```

## Editor support

Editors that understand JSON Schema validate and complete Definition files
once they are associated with the Schema. In Visual Studio Code, add this to
the workspace's `.vscode/settings.json`, with the path of your definitions
directory:

```json
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["defs/*.json"],
      "url": "https://hirunefu.github.io/smock/schema/v1/definitions.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Do not add a `$schema` field to the files themselves: smock rejects fields
the Schema does not define.

## Writing Definition files in another configuration language

smock reads only JSON and YAML, but any configuration language that exports
JSON works. This Jsonnet file,
[`docs/examples/users.jsonnet`](examples/users.jsonnet), writes one Stub per
user with a function:

```jsonnet
local getUser(id, name) = {
  id: 'get-user-%d' % id,
  mock: 'users',
  request: { method: 'GET', path: '/users/%d' % id },
  response: {
    status: 200,
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: std.manifestJsonMinified({ id: id, name: name }),
  },
};

{
  version: 1,
  mocks: [{ name: 'users' }],
  stubs: [getUser(1, 'Alice'), getUser(2, 'Bob'), getUser(3, 'Carol')],
}
```

Export it into the definitions directory, then check the result:

```sh
jsonnet users.jsonnet -o defs/users.json
smock check defs
```

The exported file is committed as the fixture
[`schema/v1/fixtures/valid/users-from-jsonnet.json`](../schema/v1/fixtures/valid/users-from-jsonnet.json),
so CI checks it with the rest. CUE (`cue export --out json`) and Pkl
(`pkl eval -f json`) work the same way.
