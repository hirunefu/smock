# Definition files

Definition files declare the Mocks smock serves and their Stubs. They live
in a definitions directory, such as `defs/`, that `smock serve --dir` and
`smock check` read:

- The Definition files are the regular files at the top level whose names
  end in `.json`, `.yaml` or `.yml`. Symlinks are followed. A YAML file
  means exactly what the equivalent JSON file means; smock accepts only the
  safe subset of YAML that the [README](../README.md) describes.
- Names that start with `.` are skipped, which covers the `..data` entries
  of Kubernetes ConfigMap volumes.
- smock reads the files in byte-wise order of their names, and reads them
  together, as one definition set: a Stub can belong to a Mock that another
  file declares.
- Body files live in the body-file subdirectory, `files/` by default
  (`--body-file-dir`, `SMOCK_BODY_FILE_DIR`). smock reads them when it
  loads the Definition files, and serves them from memory.

## Hosts and the Default Mock

One smock can stand in for several services. Each Mock lists the Hosts it
answers to, and a request goes to the Mock whose `hosts` include its Host:

```yaml
mocks:
  - name: users
    hosts: [users.example.com, "users:8080"]
    default: true
  - name: orders
    hosts: [orders.example.com]
```

- A request's Host is the authority of an absolute-form target, such as
  `GET http://orders.example.com/orders/1 HTTP/1.1`, or else its `Host`
  header.
- Hosts are exact names, with no wildcards. They are compared
  case-insensitively, without the port and without a trailing dot, so
  `Users.Example.com.:8080` is the Host `users.example.com`. An IPv6 address
  is written in brackets, such as `[::1]:8080`.
- Each Host belongs to at most one Mock. The same Host repeated within one
  Mock is fine.

A request whose Host no Mock lists, or that has none (HTTP/1.0 allows that),
goes to the Default Mock:

- the Mock marked `default: true`; at most one Mock may be marked;
- otherwise the only Mock, when the definition set declares exactly one, so
  a single Mock answers on `localhost` without any `hosts`;
- with no Mock declared at all, including an empty or missing definitions
  directory, smock serves one empty Default Mock named `default`, with no
  Hosts.

Every response the Default Mock sends because no Host matched, including
its no-match response, carries a header that says so, so that a mistyped
Host does not silently succeed:

```http
Smock-Mock: users; via=default
```

The header is ASCII: a Mock name that is not an HTTP token has its other
bytes percent-encoded, as in `%E3%83%A6...%20API`. A request for one of the
Default Mock's own Hosts gets no header.

Without a Default Mock, such a request gets a 404 that names its Host and
every Host the Mocks declare, both normalised:

```json
{"error":"no Mock for this Host","host":"usres.example.com","acceptedHosts":["users.example.com","users","orders.example.com"]}
```

`host` is `null` for a request without a Host.

## How a Stub matches a request

A Stub's `request` lists the conditions a request must meet. Every condition
given must hold, and a condition that is left out matches anything, so a
Stub without `request` matches every request of its Mock.

| Condition | A request meets it when |
|---|---|
| `method` | its method is exactly this, case and all, such as `GET`. |
| `path` | its path, percent-decoded and without the query, is exactly this. `/users/a%20b` meets `"/users/a b"`. `{ "pattern": … }`: the pattern matches the whole path. |
| `query` | each listed parameter is present, and one of its values, decoded, is exactly the given value, or matches the given `{ "pattern": … }` as a whole. Parameters that are not listed are ignored. |
| `headers` | each listed header is present, its name compared case-insensitively, and one of its values is exactly the given value, or matches the given `{ "pattern": … }` as a whole. Headers that are not listed are ignored. |
| `body` | a string: the body is exactly this text in UTF-8. `{ "pattern": … }`: the pattern matches the whole body. `{ "json": … }`: the body parses as JSON and contains the given value. |

Query parameters are decoded as HTML forms encode them: `%20` and `+` both
stand for a space, so `?q=a+b` meets `"query": { "q": "a b" }`. A parameter
without `=` has the empty value. When a parameter or a header is repeated,
the condition holds when any one of its values matches.

A `json` condition is a subset match:

- an object needs each listed key, with a value that matches in turn, and
  may have other keys;
- an array needs the same length, matched element by element;
- any other value must be equal: strings exactly, numbers by their value
  (`1` and `1.0` are equal), and `true`, `false` and `null` themselves.

A body that does not parse as JSON never meets a `json` condition.

```json
{
  "id": "create-user",
  "mock": "users",
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/users",
    "query": { "dryRun": "true" },
    "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    "body": { "json": { "name": "Alice", "roles": ["admin"] } }
  },
  "response": { "status": 201 }
}
```

### Pattern conditions

The path, a query parameter, a header and the body can each be given as a
pattern instead of an exact value, in RE2 syntax:

```json
{
  "id": "get-user",
  "mock": "users",
  "request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "path": { "pattern": "/users/[0-9]+" },
    "query": { "fields": { "pattern": "[a-z]+(,[a-z]+)*" } },
    "headers": { "Authorization": { "pattern": "Bearer [A-Za-z0-9._-]+" } }
  },
  "response": { "status": 200 }
}
```

- A pattern must match the whole value, not only part of it, so it needs
  no `^` or `$`: `/users/[0-9]+` meets `/users/42` but not
  `/users/42/orders` or `/api/users/42`.
- It is matched against the same value as an exact condition: the
  percent-decoded path without the query, the decoded values of a query
  parameter, the values of a header, and the body. When a parameter or a
  header is repeated, any one of its values may match.
- The body is matched as text in UTF-8. `.` does not match a line break
  unless the pattern turns on the `s` flag, as in `(?s)BEGIN.*END`. A body
  that is not valid UTF-8 never meets a pattern, not even `(?s).*`.
- Exact, pattern and `json` conditions can be mixed on one Stub, which then
  matches only when all of them hold. Stubs with patterns are tried in the
  same order as any other Stub.

smock supports a subset of RE2 syntax, which the
[RE2 module's README](../re2/README.mbt.md#syntax-in-r1) lists: literals,
`.`, bracket classes, `\d`, `\w` and `\s`, anchors and word boundaries,
groups, alternation, repetitions (counts up to 1000) and the flags `i`, `s`
and `m`. Matching takes time linear in the length of the value, whatever
the pattern, so no pattern can stall smock.

Patterns are compiled once, when smock loads the Definition files. A
pattern that does not compile, or that uses RE2 syntax outside the subset,
such as the Unicode class `\p{Greek}`, makes the definition set invalid.
`smock check` reports it, and `smock serve` does not start, with the JSON
Pointer of the `pattern` field and the position of the problem in the
pattern, counted in characters from 0:

```console
users.json: /stubs/0/request/path/pattern: is not a valid pattern: position 7: missing closing )
users.json: /stubs/1/request/headers/X-Region/pattern: is not a valid pattern: position 0: Unicode class \p{Greek} is not supported in R1
```

### Which Stub answers

The first Stub that matches answers. Within a Mock, Stubs are tried in this
order:

1. By `priority`: a lower number is tried first. A Stub without a priority
   is tried after every Stub with one.
2. Among equal priorities, in declaration order: files in byte-wise order
   of their names, then Stubs by their position in the file.

So a specific Stub can win over a general one wherever it is declared, by
giving it a lower priority number.

### When no Stub matches

The Mock answers with its `noMatch.status`, 404 by default, and the body
`{"error":"no Stub matched"}` with `Content-Type: application/json`. Give a
Mock the status its real service returns for unknown requests:

```json
{ "mocks": [{ "name": "users", "noMatch": { "status": 501 } }] }
```

## Responses

A Stub's `response` has a `status`, `headers`, and a body. smock sets
`Content-Length` from the body; `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding` and
`Connection` cannot be given. The body is either inline, as text in UTF-8:

```json
"response": { "status": 200, "body": "{\"id\":1}" }
```

or read from a body file, by its path relative to the body-file
subdirectory:

```json
"response": {
  "status": 200,
  "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  "bodyFile": "users/1.json"
}
```

serves the bytes of `files/users/1.json` exactly as they are. The path
cannot leave the body-file subdirectory, and none of its names may start
with `.`. A path that breaks this rule, or names a file that does not
exist, is reported with the file and JSON Pointer of the `bodyFile`, by
`smock check` and when `smock serve` starts.

## The JSON Schema

The format of Definition files is published as a JSON Schema, one per
format version. The Schema of version 1 is at

<https://hirunefu.github.io/smock/schema/v1/definitions.json>

and that URL is also its `$id`. Its source is
[`schema/v1/definitions.json`](../schema/v1/definitions.json). A file
without `version` is read as version 1; any other version is rejected.

The Schema describes every field of format version 1, including fields smock
does not implement yet. smock rejects those with a message saying they are
not supported yet, so a file never means something smock silently ignores.
smock also rejects any field the Schema does not define.

## Checking a definitions directory

`smock check <dir>` reads a definitions directory the way `smock serve`
does, so a directory that passes `smock check` loads in `smock serve`, and
the reverse. It prints every problem on its own line, with the file and a
JSON Pointer to the value, and exits with status 1. A valid directory
prints nothing and exits with status 0.

```console
$ smock check defs
20-orders.json: /stubs/0/mock: no file declares the Mock "orders"
20-orders.json: /stubs/1/request/path: must start with /
$ echo $?
1
```

`smock check` also checks the rules the Schema cannot express, because they
span the Mocks and files of the set: Mock names and Stub IDs are unique, no
two Mocks claim the same Host after normalisation, at most one Mock is
marked `default`, and every Stub names a Mock that some file declares. A
duplicate is reported where it occurs the second time, in file-name order,
and the message names the first. It also compiles every
[pattern](#pattern-conditions), which the Schema accepts as any string.

In CI, run it as a step that fails the build:

```yaml
- run: smock check defs
```

## Editor support

Editors that understand JSON Schema validate and complete Definition files
once they are associated with the Schema. In Visual Studio Code, add this to
the workspace's `.vscode/settings.json`, with the path of your definitions
directory:

```json
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["defs/*.json"],
      "url": "https://hirunefu.github.io/smock/schema/v1/definitions.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Do not add a `$schema` field to the files themselves: smock rejects fields
the Schema does not define.

## Writing Definition files in another configuration language

smock reads only JSON and YAML, but any configuration language that exports
JSON works. This Jsonnet file,
[`docs/examples/users.jsonnet`](examples/users.jsonnet), writes one Stub per
user with a function:

```jsonnet
local getUser(id, name) = {
  id: 'get-user-%d' % id,
  mock: 'users',
  request: { method: 'GET', path: '/users/%d' % id },
  response: {
    status: 200,
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: std.manifestJsonMinified({ id: id, name: name }),
  },
};

{
  version: 1,
  mocks: [{ name: 'users' }],
  stubs: [getUser(1, 'Alice'), getUser(2, 'Bob'), getUser(3, 'Carol')],
}
```

Export it into the definitions directory, then check the result:

```sh
jsonnet users.jsonnet -o defs/users.json
smock check defs
```

The exported file is committed as the fixture
[`schema/v1/fixtures/valid/users-from-jsonnet.json`](../schema/v1/fixtures/valid/users-from-jsonnet.json),
so CI checks it with the rest. CUE (`cue export --out json`) and Pkl
(`pkl eval -f json`) work the same way.
