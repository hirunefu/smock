# gRPC

A Mock can stand in for a gRPC service. It names the service's
Descriptor set, the compiled form of its `.proto` files, and smock reads
and checks the set when it loads the Definition files. This guide says how
to build a set that smock reads. The
[Definition-file reference](definition-files.md#grpc) describes the
Mock's `grpc` field.

## Building a set

smock reads no `.proto` file and runs no protoc. It reads a Descriptor
set: a FileDescriptorSet in protobuf's binary encoding, which buf and
protoc write. Build it into the body-file subdirectory of your Definition
files, `files/` by default:

```sh
buf build -o defs/files/greeter.binpb
protoc --include_imports -o defs/files/greeter.binpb helloworld.proto
```

Then name it from the Mock:

```yaml
mocks:
  - name: greeter
    hosts: [greeter.svc]
    grpc:
      descriptorSet: greeter.binpb
```

smock reads the set with the Definition files: `smock check` reads it, and
so do startup and each reload. A reload swaps the set in together with the
files, and a change to the set reloads them.

### Self-contained sets

A set must hold every file that its files import, the well-known types
such as `google/protobuf/timestamp.proto` included. `buf build` puts them
in by default. protoc puts them in only with `--include_imports`. Without
it, the set lacks the files that yours import, and `smock check` says
which:

```text
greeter.json: /mocks/0/grpc/descriptorSet: "orders.binpb": orders.proto imports common.proto, which is not in the set; build the set with protoc --include_imports, or with buf build
```

### What smock checks

Each problem with a set is a problem at the JSON Pointer of
`descriptorSet`, reported by `smock check`, at startup and on a reload.
A reload with a problem keeps serving the whole current definition set.
smock refuses a set when:

- the file is missing, or does not decode as a FileDescriptorSet;
- a file is in the set more than once;
- a file imports a file that is not in the set;
- a full name is defined twice, such as a message `shop.Order` in two
  files. An enum value's full name is in the scope of its enum's package
  or message, as protobuf scopes it, so two enums of one package cannot
  share a value name;
- a message uses a field number twice, or a field is in a oneof that its
  message does not have;
- a type that a field, a method or an extension names is not defined in
  the set;
- an extension's number is not one that its message declares for
  extensions, or is taken by another extension of the message;
- messages nest deeper than 100, or the full names of the set take more
  than 16 MiB. No set built from real `.proto` files comes near either.

buf and protoc never write a set with the other problems, but a set put
together by hand, or joined from two sets, can have them. smock checks
types only when every import is in the set and every name is defined
once, so a missing import gives one problem, not one for each type the
missing file defines.

### What smock keeps

smock keeps what it needs of each file: its name, package, syntax and
imports; its messages, nested ones included, with their fields, oneofs,
map entries and extension ranges; its enums and their values, aliases
included; its extensions and groups; and its services and methods.

It drops the rest, so it costs nothing:

- source info, the comments and positions that `buf build` keeps by
  default and that `protoc --include_source_info` adds;
- options, custom options included, except the three that change how
  messages are encoded: `map_entry`, `packed` and
  `message_set_wire_format`;
- fields that FileDescriptorSet does not define, such as the extensions
  that a Buf image adds to each file.

So a set built with `buf build -o` and its defaults, which is a Buf image
with source info, loads as it is. Files written in proto2, in proto3 or in
an edition all load.

### One set per Mock

Each Mock names its own set, so two Mocks can hold two versions of one
package, to stand in for two versions of one service:

```yaml
mocks:
  - name: greeter-v1
    hosts: [v1.greeter.svc]
    grpc:
      descriptorSet: v1/greeter.binpb
  - name: greeter-v2
    hosts: [v2.greeter.svc]
    grpc:
      descriptorSet: v2/greeter.binpb
```

A Mock without `grpc` holds no set, and costs nothing more.

### Memory

smock holds each set decoded, with the definition set it belongs to, so
every replica holds it, for as long as it serves those Definition files.
A large set costs memory in each one. For example, a set of 4.8 MB, with
5,000 messages and 100,000 fields, takes about 40 MiB once loaded, and
about 0.15 s to load. Source info costs nothing once loaded, since smock
drops it.

To keep a set small, build it from the files of the services your Mocks
stand in for, not from every file of a large repository: give protoc
only those files, or `buf build` their paths with `--path`.
